name: Run Workflows Weekly

# The purpose of this CI file is to stress test our workflows at scale.
# The *_weekly.wic workflows scatter over a much larger number of examples.
# Note that toil-cwl-runner is slightly slower than cwltool, but
# there are deadlocking problems with `cwltool --parallel`

on:
  # push:  # Do NOT run weekly workflows on every push!
  # pull_request: (either on origin or on upstream pull request)
  schedule:
  # Instead, run it every Tuesday at midnight.
    - cron: '0 0 * * 2'
  workflow_dispatch:

defaults:
  run:
    shell: bash -l {0} # Invoke bash in login mode, NOT interactive mode.
    # This will cause bash to look for the startup file ~/.bash_profile, NOT ~/.bashrc
    # This is important since conda init writes to ~/.bashrc
